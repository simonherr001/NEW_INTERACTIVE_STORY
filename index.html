His family ran as fast as they could and found an abandoned house and hid in it. But it didn't take long for the samurai to find out where they were. The samurai then burned down the house. His family escaped the fire but Yashiro did not. He was left behind because there was to much that was happening. Then once the house was burned down the leader of the samurai, Donabe found him covered with the ashes of the house.   </p>

While raising Yashiro Donabe's ways have changed. He no longer is a samurai that was money and power but now he is a samurai that is was to protect and love. Yashiro grow to an age of 16. Yashiro and Donabe were both sent to go fight a war that was not for them to fight. The war between samurai did happen though and now the size of Donabe's samurai group has decreased. The war was won but Donabe could not be found by Yashiro. Yashiro looked for Donabe over and over and he did. He was injured and didn't have long to live.

Yashiro was weak because he had just fought a war. He traveled miles and miles for days and days. Walking the whole time non stop looking for this temple. One day he comes across a place that looked like a temple to him and he tried his best to walk there but he could not anymore. He ran out of energy due to starvation. He fell being unconscious and seeing two people who had to be his parents. Then more days have passed and he wakes up in a fancy room. Two people walked in. They asked where Yashiro was from and Yashiro told them his whole story trusting in these two strangers that he never met. The two strangers said they lost their son due to a fire and he looked just like Yashiro. Yashiro spent all of his time there with those two strangers until he got better. Then when he did get better he was kicked out. Now he did think that they were his actual parents but did not know if he should go back.",

The mother left them and it was only Yashiro and the son. Yashiro spent all his years taking care of his son and training him to become a strong warrior just like him.
